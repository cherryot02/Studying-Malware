# Task 1: Does the Virus Protection work?

1.	Go to [eicar.org](https://www.eicar.org/)) find the download Anti-malware test files. (It may be hard to get this to work with good virus protect so disable.)
2.	The first link takes you to the page that explains about what they do.
3.	The files are eicar.com, eicar.com.txt, eicar_com.zip and eicarcom2.zip
4.	The file is a legitimate DOS program, and produces sensible results when run (it prints the message "EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!").
5.	What happened when you downloaded? Can you load or use the files?

## What I did
I was a little bit reluctant to download this in my main pc but I did anyway so I can test with Windows Defender.

1.  eicar.com
It redirected me to a new window with a dangerous warning, and I pointed out in number 6 in what I saw. 
 
2. eicar.txt
Before moving on to the other, I hover my mouse just to see the links and they appear to all redirect to another window. Eicar.txt did the same thing with the .com
3. Eicar.com-zip
This time, it tried to download but was blocked immediately.
 
4. eicarcom2.zip
Did the same thing with #3 but blocked by  a different av
I did notice it loaded longer (308 bytes) and and actually saw the upload bar for a quick second before it got blocked.
 
6.	Were you able to see the message that they have?
Eicar.com was the only one I could capture with the text.
This was interesting because I have never gotten a warning as red as this and never saw a “dangerous”  protocol warning before. Only Secured or Not Secured. Even the title of the page changed.. 
 

So, I closed it and opened it again but this time I saw the text for a second before the warning. I tried to capture it in split second.
