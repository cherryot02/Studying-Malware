## Task 2 Checking files or links for problems ##
1.	Create a word file called VirusTotal.docx or VirusTotal.doc, then convert the file to a "Yourname-virustotal.pdf" file. You could also include the eicar files.

2.	Open the site  VirustotalLinks to an external site. and scan the pdf file you created. Look at the detail tab and read the analysis. \
Mine resulted in undetected. Green colors. This is very cool and useful. I did not know there’s site for this and security vendors provide their found milieus website database to detect similar malicious files. I could use this to test my parent’s PC… \
 
It does show show crypted hashes and other file information… \
 
3.	Att his site you can also a URL and scan that too, check out details. Try Brccpcfix and other small sites you know of. \
I know brccfix is your site and I always wondered how you protect it from malicious code having it unsecured all this time but resulted clean in various vendors but further down it is unrated.
